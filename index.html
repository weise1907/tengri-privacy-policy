Privacy Policy for Tengri Bot

Last Updated: October 2025

1. Data We Collect

Tengri Bot collects only limited data necessary for its core features:

User IDs — for moderation, registration, and statistics systems.

Message Content — processed temporarily for moderation (swear and advertisement filters) and command execution.

Presence Information — used for activity statistics, meeting tracking, and custom role systems.

Tengri Bot does not collect or store personal data such as names, emails, or passwords.

2. How We Use the Data

Collected data is used solely to provide bot functionality, including:

Server moderation (ban, mute, jail, filters).

Leveling and leaderboard systems based on user activity.

Temporary storage for ticket, registration, and private room systems.

Activity tracking for server statistics and community engagement.

We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or AI model training.

3. Data Storage & Retention

Message content is never permanently stored — it is only processed in real time.

Minimal data (user IDs, timestamps, XP counts, moderation logs) may be stored securely in a private database.

Data is automatically deleted or anonymized when no longer needed, or upon user request.

4. Data Sharing

We do not sell, share, or transfer any data to third parties.
All collected data stays private between the bot and the Discord servers where it operates.

5. User Rights

Opt-out: Users can opt out of activity tracking by leaving the server or requesting the server owner to disable tracking for their account.

Data deletion: Users or server admins can request deletion of all stored data related to their account or server.

Transparency: Users may request details about what data the bot stores related to their account.

6. Security

We take data protection seriously. All stored data is kept in a secure database with limited access, encrypted connections, and routine maintenance to prevent unauthorized access.

7. Contact

If you have questions or would like to request data deletion, please contact the developer:
